# Arduino WebSocket Broadcast

This is a Python script that broadcasts all messages from a set Serial port
to clients using a WebSocket server. The `/app` folder contains the python
script itself, while `index.html` and `rn-websockets` are client-side programs
to test the functionality, using a web browser, or React Native, respectively.
